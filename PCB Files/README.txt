Electrocrystallization is the nucleation and crystal growth of electrodes under the influence of electric fields. This experiment uses an electric field to simulate the movement of ions from one electrode to another. Using a copper anode and cathode submerged in a Copper Sulfate solution, the ions from the anode travel through a permeable membrane to go to the cathode. As the ions travel to the cathode, they create a crystal, and the speed of the growth is affected by the current applied.  A similar crystal can be created by using a silver anode submerged in Silver Sulfate.
The effects of this experiment are still uncertain in microgravity. In our experiment, one unit will be sent to the ISS for microgravity testing, while one unit will remain on earth. The crystalâ€™s growth and microscopic properties from each unit are then going to be compared. Each unit will have multiple electrocrystallization cells to grow more samples to analyze. The goal of this experiment is to analyze the effects of microgravity in the process of electrocrystallization, possibly making the crystal less dense and grow at a faster rate. This experiment will have applications in the purification of metals, electrodeposition, and metal crystallization. 


The first pcb file is a constant current circuit that supplies a constant current to the copper and silver electrodes. This circuit works

The second pcb file includes a circuit that also supplies a constant current and can preform cyclic voltamettry with the LMP91000 chip. This circuit doesn't work and needs more work
